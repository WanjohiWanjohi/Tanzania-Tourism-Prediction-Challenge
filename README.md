# Tanzania-Tourism-Prediction-Challenge
This repository contains the notebook used for the Zindi Challenge to accurately predict the amount of money spent by a tourist in Tanzania using  up-to-date information on tourist expenditure collected by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Tanzania as described in the Zindi hackathon brief here: https://zindi.africa/hackathons/kenya-hack-tanzania-tourism-prediction-challenge
With the evaluation metric of mean squared error, running the notebook as is gives a score of 4614358.85399001 and more hyperparemeter tuning can definitely improve the perfomance.
